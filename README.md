# Brief-AI
BriefAI is a responsive web application built to simplify and structure the briefing process. It takes raw, unorganized briefs and turns them into clear, actionable documents while identifying missing information and generating clarifying questions. Designed for productivity and clarity, BriefAI is ideal for teams, individuals, or anyone working with client or project briefs.

Authentication
The app begins with a smooth and responsive authentication flow. Users can register or log in securely on pages optimized for both desktop and mobile. The layout is clean, user-friendly, and ensures a seamless entry point into the platform.

Uploading and Processing Briefs
On the Upload Brief page, users can submit a raw, unstructured brief. BriefAI processes the input and automatically generates a Structured Brief, extracts Clarifying Questions, and identifies Missing Information. This immediate breakdown saves time and improves the quality of communication and planning.

Right below the upload section, the app displays a list of recent briefs, allowing users to quickly access and review their latest submissions.

These insights help users understand their briefing trends and workload over time.
